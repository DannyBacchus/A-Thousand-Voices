			<p style="font-size: 32px">Marcel Schreur</p>
			<p>Marcel Schreur is a skill based multidisciplinary artist using the media; painting, sculpture drawing, mixed media. New media: art installation, video art, film, photography and VR. He is self-taught and started out from nowhere by painting vibrant landscapes that have been labelled post-impressionist by critics. However, since then he has used his unique painting technique and use of colour to tackle portraits, abstracts and more conceptual work with equal vigour, consequently breaking free from this initial labelling. If anything, Marcel is a pure expressionist as his extensive life experience never fails to play out on whatever he chooses and heavily affect the viewer. Pigeon-holing aside, Marcel has won numerous international prizes. All of this is somewhat inconsequential to an artist who creates largely to affect positive societal, if not humanitarian, change underpinned by his mantra: Life Is Beautiful. Always.</p>
